A Beijing nursery is accused of giving injections and feeding drugs to toddlers, in a case that has sparked outrage in China.
Authorities are now investigating the nursery, which is a branch of the well-known RYB Education chain.
The company says it "deeply apologises" for the matter that has caused "severe disquiet".
Beijing officials are also conducting a security check in all nurseries in the Chinese capital.
The incident comes weeks after a Shanghai childcare centre was alleged to have abused several toddlers.
'Forced to stand naked'
At least eight children attending the RYB Education pre-school in the upscale Chaoyang district are said to have been injected with unknown substances.
Parents told local media they had discovered needle marks on their children's bodies in recent days, and also circulated photographs online.
