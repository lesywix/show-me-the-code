You-Get
You-Get
is a tiny command-line utility to download media contents (videos, audios, images) from the Web, in case there is no other handy way to do it.
Here's how you use
you-get
to download a video from
this web page
:

And here's why you might want to use it:
You enjoyed something on the Internet, and just want to download them for your own pleasure.
You watch your favorite videos online from your computer, but you are prohibited from saving them. You feel that you have no control over your own computer. (And it's not how an open Web is supposed to work.)
You want to get rid of any closed-source technology or proprietary JavaScript code, and disallow things like Flash running on your computer.
You are an adherent of hacker culture and free software.
What
you-get
can do for you:
Download videos / audios from popular websites such as YouTube, Youku, Niconico, and a bunch more. (See the
full list of supported sites
)
Stream an online video in your media player. No web browser, no more ads.
Download images (of interest) by scraping a web page.
Download arbitrary non-HTML contents, i.e., binary files.

Getting Started
Download a video
When you get a video of interest, you might want to use the
--info
/
-i
option to see all available quality and formats:
$ you-get -i 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw'
site:                YouTube
title:               Me at the zoo
streams:             # Available quality and codecs

    - itag:          18
      container:     mp4
      quality:       medium

    - itag:          36
      container:     3gp
      quality:       small
    # download-with: you-get --itag=36 [URL]

    - itag:          17
      container:     3gp
      quality:       small
    # download-with: you-get --itag=17 [URL]
The format marked with
DEFAULT
is the one you will get by default. If that looks cool to you, download it:
$ you-get 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw'
site:                YouTube
title:               Me at the zoo
stream:
    - itag:          43
      container:     webm
      quality:       medium
      size:          0.5 MiB (564215 bytes)
    # download-with: you-get --itag=43 [URL]

Saving Me at the zoo.en.srt ...Done.
(If a YouTube video has any closed captions, they will be downloaded together with the video file, in SubRip subtitle format.)
Or, if you prefer another format (mp4), just use whatever the option
you-get
shows to you:
$ you-get --itag=18 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw'
Note:
At this point, format selection has not been generally implemented for most of our supported sites; in that case, the default format to download is the one with the highest quality.
ffmpeg
is a required dependency, for downloading and joining videos streamed in multiple parts (e.g. on some sites like Youku), and for YouTube videos of 1080p or high resolution.
If you don't want
you-get
to join video parts after downloading them, use the
--no-merge
/
-n
option.
Download anything else
If you already have the URL of the exact resource you want, you can download it directly with:
$ you-get https://stallman.org/rms.jpg
Site:       stallman.org
Title:      rms
Type:       JPEG Image (image/jpeg)
Size:       0.06 MiB (66482 Bytes)

100.0% (  0.1/0.1  MB) ├████████████████████████████████████████┤[1/1]  127 kB/s
Otherwise,
you-get
will scrape the web page and try to figure out if there's anything interesting to you:
$ you-get http://kopasas.tumblr.com/post/69361932517
Site:       Tumblr.com
Title:      kopasas
Type:       Unknown type (None)

100.0% (  0.5/0.5  MB) ├████████████████████████████████████████┤[1/1]   22 MB/s
Note:
This feature is an experimental one and far from perfect. It works best on scraping large-sized images from popular websites like Tumblr and Blogger, but there is really no universal pattern that can apply to any site on the Internet.
Search on Google Videos and download
You can pass literally anything to
you-get
. If it isn't a valid URL,
you-get
will do a Google search and download the most relevant video for you. (It might not be exactly the thing you wish to see, but still very likely.)
$ you-get "Richard Stallman eats"
Pause and resume a download
You may use
Ctrl
+
C
to interrupt a download.
A temporary
.download
file is kept in the output directory. Next time you run
you-get
with the same arguments, the download progress will resume from the last session. In case the file is completely downloaded (the temporary
.download
extension is gone),
you-get
will just skip the download.
To enforce re-downloading, use the
--force
/
-f
option. (
Warning:
doing so will overwrite any existing file or temporary file with the same name!)
Set the path and name of downloaded file
Use the
--output-dir
/
-o
option to set the path, and
--output-filename
/
-O
to set the name of the downloaded file:
$ you-get -o ~/Videos -O zoo.webm 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw'
Tips:
These options are helpful if you encounter problems with the default video titles, which may contain special characters that do not play well with your current shell / operating system / filesystem.
These options are also helpful if you write a script to batch download files and put them into designated folders with designated names.
Proxy settings
You may specify an HTTP proxy for
you-get
to use, via the
--http-proxy
/
-x
option:
$ you-get -x 127.0.0.1:8087 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw'
However, the system proxy setting (i.e. the environment variable
http_proxy
) is applied by default. To disable any proxy, use the
--no-proxy
option.
Tips:
If you need to use proxies a lot (in case your network is blocking certain sites), you might want to use
you-get
with
proxychains
and set
alias you-get="proxychains -q you-get"
(in Bash).
For some websites (e.g. Youku), if you need access to some videos that are only available in mainland China, there is an option of using a specific proxy to extract video information from the site:
--extractor-proxy
/
-y
.
Watch a video
Use the
--player
/
-p
option to feed the video into your media player of choice, e.g.
mplayer
or
vlc
, instead of downloading it:
$ you-get -p vlc 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw'
Or, if you prefer to watch the video in a browser, just without ads or comment section:
$ you-get -p chromium 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw'
Tips:
It is possible to use the
-p
option to start another download manager, e.g.,
you-get -p uget-gtk 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw'
, though they may not play together very well.
Load cookies
Not all videos are publicly available to anyone. If you need to log in your account to access something (e.g., a private video), it would be unavoidable to feed the browser cookies to
you-get
via the
--cookies
/
-c
option.
Note:
As of now, we are supporting two formats of browser cookies: Mozilla
cookies.sqlite
and Netscape
cookies.txt
.
Reuse extracted data
Use
--url
/
-u
to get a list of downloadable resource URLs extracted from the page. Use
--json
to get an abstract of extracted data in the JSON format.
Warning:
For the time being, this feature has
NOT
been stabilized and the JSON schema may have breaking changes in the future.
